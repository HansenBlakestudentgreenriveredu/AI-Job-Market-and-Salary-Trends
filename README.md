# AI Job Market and Salary Trends - Final Project

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the **Global AI Job Market and Salary Trends (2025)** dataset to explore factors affecting AI job roles and salaries worldwide. The goal is to perform data analysis and build machine learning models to predict salary trends and job market insights.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle:

[Global AI Job Market and Salary Trends 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bismasajjad/global-ai-job-market-and-salary-trends-2025)

You can download the CSV file and place it in the `/data` folder of this repository.

## Project Requirements

The project will cover:

- **Data Loading & Preparation:** Import and clean the dataset to handle missing data and prepare features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize and understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement and compare at least two models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) for predicting salary or other key outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation:** Use metrics like RMSE, RÂ², or classification metrics depending on the task to assess model performance.
- **Interpretation:** Analyze feature importance and draw actionable insights from the models.
- **Additional Considerations:** Address data preprocessing, feature engineering, and any imbalanced data issues.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HansenBlakestudentgreenriveredu/AI-Job-Market-and-Salary-Trends.git
    cd AI-Job-Market-and-Salary-Trends
    ```

2. Place the dataset CSV file inside the `/data` folder.

3. Open the Jupyter notebook located in `/notebooks` to start exploring the data and building models.
